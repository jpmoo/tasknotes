# TaskNotes 4.2.1

## Added

- New Calendars API endpoint for access to calendar data
  - Access calendar provider information and connection status
  - Query events from Google Calendar, Microsoft Calendar, and ICS subscriptions
  - Filter events by date range
  - [`tasknotes-cli`](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes-cli) has been updated to make use of this endpoint

## Fixed

- (#1424) Fixed "Create New Task" command creating tasks in active folder instead of default folder
  - "Create New Task" now correctly uses the configured default task folder
  - "Create New Inline Task" continues to use the inline task folder setting
  - Thanks to @Gogo-XD for reporting and @TonyAtlas for confirming

- (#1421), (#1042) Fixed natural language parser only setting one date when both scheduled and due dates are specified
  - Entering something like "task due Jan 9 at Jan 9" now correctly sets both the due date and scheduled date
  - Thanks to @wealthychef1 and @dblinnikov for reporting

- (#1410) Fixed vim insert mode not activating in task creation modal
  - The modal now correctly enters insert mode when vim keybindings are enabled
  - Thanks to @Leo310 for the feature request

- (#1422) Fixed tags with dashes not being parsed correctly
  - Tags like `#my-tag` were being truncated to `#my`
  - Thanks to @JerryLu086 for reporting

- (#1419) Fixed custom statuses and priorities not saving in settings
  - Values entered in text fields were sometimes lost when closing the settings modal
  - Thanks to @s33a for reporting
