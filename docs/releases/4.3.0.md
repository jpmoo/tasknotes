# TaskNotes 4.3.0

## Changed

- (#1437) Unified template variable syntax and available variables across filename and body templates
  - Both systems now use double-brace `{{variable}}` syntax consistently
  - Single-brace `{variable}` syntax remains supported for backwards compatibility but is deprecated
  - Settings UI shows a warning when deprecated single-brace syntax is detected
  - Filename templates gain body template variables: `{{contexts}}`, `{{tags}}`, `{{hashtags}}`, `{{timeEstimate}}`, `{{details}}`, `{{parentNote}}`
  - Body templates gain filename template variables: `{{zettel}}`, `{{nano}}`, and all extended date/time variables
  - Thanks to @23maverick23 for reporting

## Added

- (#1361) Option to disable inline task overlay for aliased wikilinks
  - New setting in Features → Inline Tasks: "Disable overlay for aliased links"
  - When enabled, links with aliases like `[[Task|Check Status]]` render as plain links
  - Links without aliases continue to show the interactive task widget
  - Useful when embedding tasks in prose where the widget would be disruptive
  - Thanks to @diegomarzaa for the contribution and @jldiaz for proposing this feature in #1117

- (#1199, #1205) Google Calendar export for tasks
  - Sync tasks to Google Calendar based on scheduled or due dates
  - Automatic sync on task create, update, complete, and delete
  - Configurable event title templates with placeholders (`{{title}}`, `{{status}}`, `{{priority}}`, etc.)
  - Event descriptions include task metadata and optional Obsidian deep link
  - Support for all-day or timed events with customizable duration
  - Event color customization using Google Calendar's color palette
  - Default reminder setting for popup notifications
  - Bulk sync and unlink actions in settings
  - Task-event linking stored in frontmatter (`googleCalendarEventId`)
  - Recurring tasks sync as Google Calendar recurring events
  - Completed or skipped recurring instances are automatically excluded
  - Thanks to @someromans and @Leonard-44 for requesting this feature, and @dmantisk, @farangkao, @rayvermey, and @rdpr for their input

## Fixed

- (#1413) Fixed angle-bracket links and project title display
  - Angle-bracket links like `[Spec](<Projects/Client X/Spec.md>)` now resolve correctly
  - Project links display frontmatter `title` instead of raw filename/path when available
  - Dependency values normalize consistently across wikilinks, markdown links, and angle-bracket variants
  - Many thanks to @normenmueller for the contribution

- (#1414) Kanban column headers now display configured priority labels instead of raw values
  - Many thanks to @normenmueller for the contribution

- (#1416) Fixed property-based task identification mutating tags unexpectedly
  - Tags are only written when explicitly changed by the user
  - Task tag is only added in tag-based identification mode
  - Fixes #1391
  - Thanks to @loukandr for reporting and @normenmueller for the fix

- (#1187) Fixed "Unknown view types" error when opening Bases views after upgrading from pre-V4
  - Users who had disabled Bases support in earlier versions could not open Bases views after upgrading
  - Settings migration now automatically re-enables Bases support since the toggle was removed in V4
  - Thanks to @MiracleXYZ for reporting

- (#1144) Fixed relationships.base showing empty views for Projects, Blocked By, and Blocking tabs
  - The top-level task filter was excluding non-task files from the Projects view
  - Projects can be any file type (not just tasks), so the filter is now applied per-view
  - Subtasks, Blocked By, and Blocking views retain the task filter; Projects view does not
  - Users with existing relationships.base files should delete and regenerate them to get the fix
  - Thanks to @needo37 for reporting, and @n1njaznutz, @nestor50, and @IvyDliu for investigating and confirming the solution

- Fixed calendar view type not persisting or applying when changed
  - View type changes via header buttons (week/day/month) are now saved to the .base file
  - View type changes via Bases settings panel now apply immediately without reload

- (#1441) Fixed task dragging broken with "Span tasks between scheduled and due dates" enabled
  - Span events can now be dragged to move tasks in time
  - Dragging shifts both scheduled and due dates proportionally, preserving the span duration
  - Previously, dragging span events would cause a visual/data mismatch where the calendar showed the wrong position
  - Thanks to @Peeeet for reporting
