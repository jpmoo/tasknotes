# TaskNotes 4.3.1

## Added

- (#1546) Added sticky kanban column headers that remain visible while scrolling
  - Thanks to @normenmueller for the contribution

- (#1458) Added CSS color classes to context tags for custom styling
  - Each context tag now receives a unique CSS class based on its name (e.g., `context-tag--color-0` through `context-tag--color-19`)
  - Enables styling individual contexts via CSS snippets
  - Thanks to @phortx for the contribution

- Added [mdbase-spec](https://mdbase.dev) type definition generation
  - New setting in Integrations tab to generate mdbase-spec v0.2.0 type definition files (`mdbase.yaml` and `_types/task.md`) at the vault root
  - Type definitions are derived from TaskNotes settings (statuses, priorities, field mappings, user fields) and regenerated automatically when settings change
  - Enables interoperability with other tools that support the mdbase-spec format

## Fixed

- (#1472) Fixed task dependencies not being stored as wikilinks in frontmatter
  - Dependencies now retain their `[[wikilink]]` format when saved, preventing them from breaking on file rename
  - Thanks to @renekalff for reporting

- (#1443) Fixed default status/priority not updating when the referenced custom value is deleted
  - Deleting a custom status or priority that was set as the default now resets the default to the first available value
  - Thanks to @l-mb for the contribution

- (#1448) Fixed project removals not persisting from the task edit modal
  - Removing all projects from a task now correctly clears the projects field
  - Different link formats (e.g., markdown links vs wikilinks) no longer cause false change detection
  - Thanks to @normenmueller for the contribution

- (#1514), (#1517) Fixed task reminders not syncing to Google Calendar
  - Task-specific reminders (both relative and absolute) now sync to Google Calendar
  - Previously only the global default reminder setting was used, ignoring per-task reminders
  - Thanks to @christenbc for the contribution

- (#1525), (#1531) Fixed subtask status dot not refreshing visually when clicked
  - Status dot, checkbox, and card styling now update instantly when cycling status
  - Thanks to @christenbc for the contribution

- (#1537) Fixed Google Calendar errors during bulk sync
  - Added rate limiting to space out API calls, preventing errors when syncing many tasks at once
  - Thanks to @Lorite for the contribution

- (#1515), (#1540) Fixed time loss when setting recurrence and recurrence not clearing from Google Calendar
  - Setting recurrence on a task with a scheduled time now preserves the time, preventing Google Calendar events from appearing as all-day
  - Clearing recurrence from a task now also removes it from the synced Google Calendar event
  - Thanks to @christenbc for the contribution

- (#1428), (#1559) Fixed hierarchical tags with slashes (e.g., `#project/sub-project`) being truncated in link text
  - Tags containing slashes, hyphens, and Unicode characters now render correctly
  - Thanks to @normenmueller for the contribution and @ysafonov for reporting

- (#1565) Fixed Google Calendar target calendar dropdown appearing empty after app restart
  - The dropdown now re-populates once calendars are fetched during startup
  - Thanks to @N-HEDGER for reporting

- (#1567) Fixed inline task card widgets disappearing momentarily
  - When the task cache is temporarily cleared (e.g., during Smart Connections processing), the previously-rendered widget is now preserved instead of reverting to a plain wiki link
  - Thanks to @scztt for reporting

- (#1568) Fixed deleted tasks not being removed from Google Calendar
  - When a task file is deleted outside of TaskNotes (e.g., via Obsidian's file manager), the synced Google Calendar event is now cleaned up automatically
  - Thanks to @kmaustral for reporting

- Fixed Integrations tab spacing and layout issues
  - Improved positioning of buttons and status indicators across Google Calendar, ICS, and Webhooks sections
