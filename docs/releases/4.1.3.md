# TaskNotes 4.1.3

This patch fixes a critical performance issue affecting the Calendar views. As a bonus, it adds a configurable "split" view to the task creation/edit modals. 

## Added

- Split layout for task modals on wide screens (900px+)
  - Details editor appears in a dedicated right column when the modal is expanded
  - New setting "Split layout on wide screens" in Modal Fields settings tab to toggle this behavior
  - Improves usability by showing form fields and details side-by-side

## Fixed

- (#1330) Fixed calendar view regression taking 5 seconds to load and respond to user interactions
  - Initial calendar load is now immediate again
  - User interactions (drag/drop, creating timeblocks, etc.) respond instantly
  - Removed redundant date filtering (FullCalendar handles this more efficiently)
  - Thanks to @ysafonov, @kmaustral, @sunjiawe, @Мизгирь, and @FiliusIcari for reporting
