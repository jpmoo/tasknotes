  "ai_summary": "Support external journaling plugins (e.g., Journals) for timeblock creation",
  "notes": "Feature request to allow timeblock creation with journaling plugins other than the native Daily Notes plugin. Currently, the codebase is tightly coupled to obsidian-daily-notes-interface (v0.9.4). The TimeblockCreationModal requires appHasDailyNotesPluginLoaded() at line 271, and uses getAllDailyNotes()/getDailyNote()/createDailyNote() for daily note discovery. To support external plugins like 'Journals' (obsidian-journal), we need: 1) An abstraction layer/interface for daily note resolution, 2) Adapter implementations for different journal plugins, 3) Settings to select which journal system to use, 4) Optional metadata/path/format configuration for custom daily note discovery. This is a significant architectural change requiring a plugin adapter pattern.",
  "suggested_fix": "Create a JournalProvider interface with methods like getDailyNoteForDate(), createDailyNoteForDate(), and hasDailyNotePlugin(). Implement adapters: NativeDailyNotesProvider (using obsidian-daily-notes-interface) and JournalsPluginProvider (for obsidian-journal). Add a setting to choose the journal provider. Update TimeblockCreationModal, calendar-core.ts, and helpers.ts to use the abstraction instead of direct obsidian-daily-notes-interface calls.",
