  "notes": "User wants the 'Create new inline task' command to respect {{currentNotePath}} template variable for the destination folder, similar to how inline conversion (checkbox to task) already works. IMPLEMENTED: TaskService.createTask() at line 233 now includes 'manual-creation' in the same condition as 'inline-conversion', allowing both contexts to use the inlineTaskConvertFolder setting with {{currentNotePath}} and {{currentNoteTitle}} variable support. Unit test added at tests/unit/services/TaskService.test.ts:299-321 which passes. Release notes added in docs/releases/unreleased.md.",
  "suggested_fix": "Implemented by adding 'manual-creation' to the condition at TaskService.ts:233 that checks for inline-conversion context. This applies the inlineTaskConvertFolder setting with template variable support to both checkbox conversion and the 'Create new inline task' command.",
