# Embedded Task List Test

This note contains an embedded task list base view for testing Issue #1261.

The issue is that when this note is dragged to a sidebar, there are two scrollbars:
one for the task list view and one for the note itself.

![[TaskNotes/Views/tasks-default.base]]

## Additional content

This content is below the embedded base view to ensure the note has enough content to scroll.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
- Item 4
- Item 5
